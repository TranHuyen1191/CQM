# CQM: Cumulative quality model for HTTP Adaptive Streaming
* This source code is an implementation in MATLAB of our cumulative quality model (CQM).
* Note that window quality can be obtained by different existing models for overall quality 
* If you use the ITU-P1203 model as the window quality model, please see the requirements in https://github.com/itu-p1203/itu-p1203/


## How to use 
### F_CQM.m      : Function to calculate predicted cumulative quality values from CQM model
#### Input 
- iniD      : Initial duration (seconds)
- SQArr     : One-dimensional array of segment quality values in the range [1,5] (MOS)
- SPArr     : One-dimensional array of stalling positions (seconds)
- SDArr     : One-dimensional array of stalling durations (seconds)
- wqModel   : Window quality model 1: Tran's; 2: Guo's; 3: Vriendt's; 4: Yin's 5: p1203 (default: 1)
- sizeW     : Window size (seconds) (default: 50)
- weight    : Weights of the last, minimun, and average window quality values (default: [0.31 0.29 0.40]) 

#### Output
- CQM: Array of predicted cumulative quality values  

#### Example
A 120-second long session has 120 segments. 
The quality of the 1st-60th segments is 5 MOS.
The quality of the 61st-80th segments is 2 MOS.
The quality of the 81st-120th segments is 4 MOS.
There are three stalling events as follows. 
1. Initial delay:    
	Starting time: 0s 		      Length: 2s
2. Interruption:    
	Starting time: 40s 		      Length: 2s
	
	Starting time: 60s 		      Length: 4s

To obtain the output, you can use the following command. 
  ```
  CQM= F_CQM(2,[5*ones(1,60),2*ones(1,20),4*ones(1,40)],[40,60],[2,4])
  ```
